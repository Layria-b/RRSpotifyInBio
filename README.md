Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy so to liek use it and stuffs you need to

#5 cause i suck at coding and i couldnt figure out the authentication for the spotify api you have to go to this(https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-users-currently-playing-track/) website, look for a box called 'Oauth Token' and then next to it it should say 'Get Token', click that and then it should say 'Required scopes for this endpoint' simpily click the box underneath that and then click Request Token and then copy the token in the 'Oauth Token' box and paste it into the ACCESS_TOKEN variable
#6 press CTRL + S, then close the file and run in command prompt!

should note that the token becomes invaild in a hour so you will have to make a new one every hour(i know its really annoying i should just figure out how to do da auth stuff but its confusing if anyone can halp me please message me LameLexi#7004)

ok uh, bye bye :3
