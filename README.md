Heyiiaa, this is a script that changes your bio based on what song your playing right now. due to how rec room caches bios you cant see it update in realtime. if you change games it should update!

How To Run:

#1 Download the file from the releases section then open the file in notepad
#2 near the top there should be some text saying 'Rec Room Auth Stuff' and below it there are 2 variables called USERNAME and PASSWORD, enter your Rec Room username/password here!
#3 go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login and login in to your spotify account, when youve logged in click the 'create an app' button and give it a random name and discription and then click create. 
You should be brought to a screen that looks like this.

Click the 'Edit Settings' button near the bottom of the screen you should see a box called 'redirect_uri' click on the box and copy and paste this ->(put link here me) in there and hit add then paste the same link into the 'redirct_uri' varible on the script!
#4 click the x button on that menu and then on the left of the page there should be a thing called a 'client_id' copy that and paste into the script into the variable called you guessed it client_id, under taht a thing called 'show client secret' click that and then paste the client_secret into the 'client_secret' varible on the script.
